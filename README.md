# DBB Community Repository

Welcome to the IBM Dependency Based Build (DBB) community repository. The helpful and handy location for finding and sharing example DBB scripts and snippets when building out DevOps pipelines for the mainframe.

## Resources

* [IBM Dependency Based Build Product Page](https://www.ibm.com/products/dependency-based-build)
* [IBM DBB Documentation](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/dbb)
* [IBM DBB zBuilder Build Framework](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/adffz/dbb/3.0.0?topic=zbuilder-getting-started) - DBB zBuilder is an integrated configuration-based build framework for building z/OS applications. Build configuration is defined in YAML files.
* [IBM DBB zAppBuild](https://github.com/IBM/dbb-zappbuild) - The zAppBuild project is a community-driven build framework implemented in Groovy.
* [IBM DBB Git Migration Modeler](https://github.com/IBM/dbb-git-migration-modeler/) - An asset to provide a guided approach to plan and migrate source codebase, and help to identify and document the boundaries of mainframe applications.
* [IBM Development and Pipeline Community](https://community.ibm.com/community/user/ibmz-and-linuxone/groups/topic-home?CommunityKey=f461c55d-159c-4a94-b708-9f7fe11d972b)

## Versions

Branches convey the purpose of their assets. [Releases](https://github.com/IBM/dbb/releases) are published frequently to highlight important updates. Tags no longer mirror product version numbers — samples document their own version requirements. Backward compatibility is not a primary objective.

> [!NOTE]
> In future releases, the repository layout will be simplified. In a next generation of the `main` branch, `main` will focus on assets targeting the use of the zBuilder framework with DBB 3.0 and later. A new epic branch will support the development of required changes. Contents of the current `main` branch will be kept available via a new `groovy-based` branch, acting as a maintenance branch, that will provide access to existing Groovy-based assets.

Until this change, the below branches' purposes are:

* [main](https://github.com/IBM/dbb/tree/main) - keeps the existing structure for both zBuilder and Groovy-based assets.

* [simplify/community-templates](https://github.com/IBM/dbb/tree/simplify/community-templates) - the new development branch focussing on the zBuilder framework with DBB 3.0 and later. This holds the simplified, designated target layout for the project.

See [releases](https://github.com/IBM/dbb/releases) for prior versions of the community assets.
