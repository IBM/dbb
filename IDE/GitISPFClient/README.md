## Purpose

The purpose of this GitHub repository is to provide an ISPF interface that interacts with a Git repository to allow cloning, staging, checking in, pushing and pulling as well as other git commands. 

------------
## How-To Install

### Prerequisites

You must have Rocket Git installed in USS on the z/OS system you plan to use. You can install Rocket Git using SMP/E as part of IBM z Open Development or you can go to www.rocketSoftware/git for instructions on getting Rocket Git. . You need Rocket Git to run git commands on z/OS. 

### Copy USS files to PDS

In the clone location there is a directory called `IDE/GitISPFClient/sbgzsamp`. There is a file there called `bgzgit.jcl`. This JCL member will allocate a set of PDS libraries and copy the files from the clone location. Make a copy of this JCL member in a data set on z/OS. Tailor as per the instuctions in the job and submit the Job. The job should finish with a return code of 0 and have populated the specified libraries. 

### Initial configuration

In the libraries you created by running the BGZGIT JCL member there is a SBGZEXEC library. In there there is  BGZCONF member. Edit this member and look for the 4 install locations specified there, by default:

JAVA_HOME   = '/usr/lpp/java/J8.0_64'    
Rocket_HOME = '/rsusr/ported'              
DBB_HOME    = '/usr/lpp/IBM/dbb'           
ICONV_HOME  = '/bin/iconv'

Change these values to where you have Java, Rocket Tools and iconv installed on your system. You can also set DBB_HOME if you have installed DBB already. 

------------

## Running the ISPF Git Client

There are several methods for starting the ISPF Git client.

Start the ISPF Git client dialog using the BGZGIT REXX executable code. You can run the executable code in several ways:

* From the TSO command processor panel:
    * On the TSO command processor panel, enter **EX '<hlq>.SBGZEXEC(BGZ)'**
* Added to an ISPF menu:
    * Set &ZSEL to **'CMD(EX <hlq>.SBGZEXEC(BGZGIT)) NOCHECK'**. NOCHECK supports the entry of concatenated commands through the direct option (trail). On the calling panel, also specify **&ZTRAIL=.TRAIL**.
* Added as a command in the SYSPROC concatenation:
    * Create an EXEC in the SYSPROC concatenation (for example, BGZGIT) that starts the BGZGIT EXEC with any required parameters hardcoded: 
    * **ex 'BGZ.SBGZEXEC(BGZGIT)'**
    * After creating the executable code, run the code from the command line. Enter the following command: **TSO %BGZGIT**.
    * If the command is added to a command table, enter **%BGZGIT**.

### Preferences

Once you have started the ISPF Git client you should go to Option **0 - Preferences**. There are 4 options here:

Preference                    | Description 
------------------------------| -----------
Client Code Page              | The code page that will be used to convert between native characters on the host, and unicode escape sequences on the github repository. Default is IBM-037                        
Git user.email                | user.email used for Git commands - Currently not used
Git user.name                 | user name used for Git commands - Currently not used             
Suppress .files from USS list | To not display .files on working directory list (default is Yes) 

### Cloning a remote repository
To start working on code in a remote Git repository go to option **2 - Repository**. Enter the repository address in the line at the top of the screen, for example **git@github.com:campagboy/dbb.git**. It should be noted that Rockets Git port for z/OS currently only supports clone Git repositories through SSH. As such you will be required to set up private and public keys. In addition it should be noted that, at this time, the Git ISPF Client does not support interactively entering passwords for the keys, so as such the public/private key pair need to be created with no password. See **https://forum.rocketsoftware.com/t/using-git-for-z-os-with-github/654** for information on generating an ssh key pair on z/OS. Next to the git repository you will need to enter a working tree directory. The directory you specify will have an extra directory level added of the repository being cloned. So in the example above, if you enter **/u/myuser/git** as your working directory, then the actual working directory created will be **/u/myuser/git/dbb**. Once you press enter the repository will be cloned into the working tree directory. 

It is important to note that as Git is a Hierarchical file system SCM, the folders and files in the repository are cloned into the HFS and not into PDS/PDSE. 

### Working with files in a remote repository
Once a repository is cloned you can choose to work on the files either through the ISPF Git interface or you can work on them directly through ISPF UDLIST (3.17), or using your editor of choice through OMVS. 

The Git commands you use generally work at a repository level as opposed to a file level. However there are some Git commands that affect individual files. Using the ISPF Git Client you can enter a **/** on any line to see a list of available options, or you can use the fast path command. On any panel press **PF1** to get a list of the available commands and their explanation. All of the repository level git commands can be entered on all the panels, for example the file list panel, but still work at the repository level. This allows you to edit a file, stage it, commit it and push it without having to return to the repository panel.

To start working with files through the ISPF Git interface enter **JU** (Jump to Working Directory) next to the repository that contains your files. From here you will see a list of folders and files. To drill down into a directory enter an **L** next to the directory. The available options at a file level are:

Option  | Description 
------- | -----------
E       | Edit file (EBCDIC)
EA      | Edit file (ASCII)  
EU      | Edit file (UTF-8)  
V       | View file (EBCDIC) 
VA      | View file (ASCII) 
VU      | View file (UTF-8) 
B       | Browse file
D       | Delete file
R       | Rename file

To create a new file enter S <filename> on the command line. Make sure you give the filename an extension that matches an entry in your .gitattributes file. This way, when the file is added to staging it will automatically be tagged with the correct CCSID. 
    
### Issuing Git commands against a repository
Most Git commands work against the repository. You can enter the Git commands from any line command entry field. Again, enter a **/** to see the options available, or use the fast path Git commands which are:

Option  | Description 
------- | -----------
ST      | Git Status
AD      | Git Add (or stage)  
CO      | Git Commit
PS      | Git Push
CP      | Git Commit and Push
PL      | Git Pull

The above commands are the standard Git commands, but through the use of ISPF panels and tables certain actions can be performed. 

#### ST - Git Status
Issues the Git status against the repository. You will be informed of files that are unstaged or uncommitted.

#### AD - Git Add
If you have modified a file, renamed a file, added a file or deleted a file, you will need to stage the change before you can commit it. When you enter the **AD** command, you will see a list of files that are currently unstaged. You can select which files, at this time, you want to add to staging.

#### CO - Git Commit
Once files are staged they can be committed. Enter the **CO** to bring up the commit dialog. At this point you will see a list of files that will be committed. You can enter an **R** next to any files you want to return to being unstaged. Then enter a comment and press enter and all the files ready to be committed will be committed.

#### PS - Git Push
Once files are committed they can be pushed to the repository. On the repository screen, if there are any files ready to be pushed you will see a "\*" next to the repository name. Enter **PS** and the files will be pushed. If there are any problems the dialog will inform you. For example if there are some chamges you need to Pull first.

#### CP - Git Commit and Push
This is a combination of commit and push in a single command.

#### PL - Git Pull
If there are any files in the repository that have been updated you will need to pull the changes into your local clone.

-------------------------
You can also enter any other valid Git command through the Git command prompt. On any line command enter a **/** and press enter, then select **Git Command Prompt**. You will be presented with a panel where you can enter any valid git command. For example Git Diff, or Git Merge. 

### Adding new files
To create a new file in a directory, from the file list enter **S <filename>** and press enter. The ISPF editor panel opens where you can work on the file you have just created. Please note that to be able to successfully stage and commit the file, the extension used must exist in the **.gitattributes** file. 

### Working with branches
NMext to your cloned repository enter the **BR** command to work with the branches in your repository. From here you can perform the following actions with the following commands:

Option  | Description 
------- | -----------
CB      | Checkout to working branch
PB      | Push branch to origin     
DB      | Delete local branch       
JU      | Jump to working directory 

The Checkout to local branch will replace the conmtents of your work tree with the files from the branch you selected. 

### Finished working with a clone?
Once you have finished working with a clone you can remove it by entering an **RM** next to the repository name. This will delete the working directory as well. 

### Creating a local git repository
