This panel allows you to create a new local repository.                         
<P>                                                                             
You need to enter the working directory where to initialize the repository.     
Executing git init creates a .git subdirectory in the current working directory,
which contains all of the necessary Git metadata for the new repository.        
<p>                                                                             
A quick note: git init and git clone can be easily confused.                    
At a high level, they can both be used to "initialize a new git repository."    
However, git clone is dependent on git init. git clone is used to create a copy 
of an existing repository.                                                      
Internally, git clone first calls git init to create a new repository. It then  
copies the data from the existing repository, and checks out a new set of       
working files.
