This panel allows you to view and manage your cloned repositories.              
Only repositories cloned by the currently z/OS logged in user will              
be displayed.                                                                   
<P>                                                                             
To clone a new repository, enter it's github address and the working directory  
location where you want to have it cloned.                                      
If your repository address or your working directory is greater than the field  
provided then you can scroll left or right or press<HP>PF4</HP>to get a         
scrollable field entry panel.                                                   
<P>                                                                             
A cloned repository may have a <HP>'*'</HP> decorator to their left indicating  
your branch is ahead of 'origin/branch' by n commit(s).                         
You have to use "git push" to publish your local commits.                       
<P>                                                                             
Enter a <HP>'/'</HP> in the area next to a cloned repository to see
