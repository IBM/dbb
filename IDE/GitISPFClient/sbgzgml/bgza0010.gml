This panel allows you to generate a new ssh key to use for authentication.      
<P>                                                                             
If you don't already have an SSH key, you must generate a new SSH key. If you're
unsure whether you already have an SSH key, check for existing keys :           
<p>                                                                             
Open Git Bash from omvs Git installed directory,                                
Enter ls -al ~/.ssh to see if existing SSH keys are present,                    
Check the directory listing to see if you already have a public SSH key.
