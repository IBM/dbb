This panel allows you to list all the branches in your repository, and also     
tell you the branch you are currently working in (the one with <HP>'*'</HP>).   
<P>                                                                             
To create a new branch, enter a branch name on the first intput line.           
<P>                                                                             
Enter a <HP>'/'</HP> in the area next to a branch to see a menu of actions, or  
enter an action shortcut character from the following list:
