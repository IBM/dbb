# Pipeline Templates

This category provides templates to implement a CI/CD pipeline covering the entire development lifecycle. These assets are developed based on [The Git branching model for mainframe development](https://ibm.github.io/z-devops-acceleration-program/docs/git-branching-model-for-mainframe-dev) and help you to quickly setup your pipeline environment. Prior to implementing these templates, you should get familiar with the outlined Git branching model.

## Table of Contents 
Asset | Description | Documentation Link
--- | --- | ---
Common-Backend-Scripts | Core asset to simplify defining the pipeline orchestration by providing central services for the various stages of the CI/CD pipeline. Especially useful for pipeline architectures which don't provide a native runner . | [Common-Backend-Scripts/README.md](Common-Backend-Scripts/README.md)
Azure DevOps Pipeline Template | Template to setup a [AzureDevOps pipeline](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/?view=azure-devops&viewFallbackFrom=azure-pipelines) to build, package and deploy Azure Repos Git. | [AzureDevOpsPipeline/README.md](AzureDevOpsPipeline/README.md)
Gitlab CI/CD Pipeline Template | .gitlab-ci.yml template to setup a [Gitlab CI/CD pipeline](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/pipelines/) to build, package and deploy Gitlab platform. | [GitlabCIPipeline/README.md](GitlabCIPipeline/README.md)
GitHub Actions Pipeline Template | Template to setup a [GitHub Actions Pipeline](https://docs.github.com/en/actions) to build, package, and deploy a GitHub repository. | [GitHubActionsPipeline/README.md](GitHubActionsPipeline/README.md)
Jenkins Multibranch Pipeline Template | Multibranch pipeline template to setup a [Jenkins CI/CD pipeline](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/multibranch/) to build, package and deploy with any Git provider. | [JenkinsPipeline/README.md](JenkinsPipeline/README.md)

## Capabilities of Pipeline Templates 

The below tables provide an overview of the implemented capabilities of the pipeline templates. The information can be used to lookup and understand the variations in the implementations. The :red_circle: icon indicates that this step uses a [Common Backend Script](Common-Backend-Scripts/).

### Technology in use with CI/CD orchestrators

 <br>  | Azure DevOps | GitLab CI | GitHub Actions | Jenkins
--- | --- | --- | --- | ---
**CI Runner/Agent topology** | ADO runner | gitlab-runner shell executor | GitHub Actions runner | Jenkins node on z/OS
**Git Provider** | Azure DevOps | GitLab | GitHub | Any Git provider
**Deployment technology** | IBM Wazi Deploy | IBM Wazi Deploy | IBM Wazi Deploy | IBM DevOps Deploy (a.k.a. UCD)
**Communication between CI platform and z/OS** | SSH | IBM RSE API Plug-in for Zowe CLI | SSH | Jenkins-managed
**Additional integration technologies** | Azure DevOps CLI | GitLab REST interface | GitHub CLI | 
**Pipeline extensions** |       |       |      | SonarQube sonar-scanner

### Implemented pipeline tasks

All templates implement the recommended working practice, that is documented within the [IBM zDevOps Guide](https://ibm.github.io/z-devops-acceleration-program/docs/git-branching-model-for-mainframe-dev).
It is made of:
* a **feature branch pipeline**, that provides an early feedback to developers about the impacted components of their changes, building a preliminary package that can be tested in an isolated environment,
* an **integration pipeline**, that is triggered when merging changes into an integration branch such as the `main`, `release` maintenance or `epic` branch
* a **release pipeline**, that builds all contributed changes for the iteration, creates a release candidate package and allows to drive deployments into controlled test environments.

The below table provides an overview of the capabilities that are implemented in the various templates. The second column in the table indicates for which types of pipeline the capability is available:   
:small_blue_diamond: feature branch pipeline  
:small_orange_diamond: build pipeline for integration branches  
:small_red_triangle: release pipeline
