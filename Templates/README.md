# Pipeline Templates

This category provides templates to implement a CI/CD pipeline covering the entire development lifecycle. These assets are developed based on `The Git-based process you need for Mainframe development`. Please make yourself familiar with the proposed development process.

## Table of Contents 
Asset | Description | Documentation Link
--- | --- | ---
Common-Backend-Scripts | Core asset to simplify defining the pipeline orchestration by providing central services for the various stages of the CI/CD pipeline. Especially useful for pipeline architectures which don't provide a native runner .  | [Common-Backend-Scripts/README.md](Common-Backend-Scripts/README.md)

We are expecting additional templates in this category for the various pipeline orchestrators such as AzureDevOps or Github Actions leveraging the Common Backend scripts.
