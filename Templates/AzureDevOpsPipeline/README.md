# Azure DevOps pipeline template

This template provides an [azure-pipelines.yml](azure-pipelines.yml) definition file to setup an Azure DevOps Pipeline for applications managed in an Azure Git repository.

## Overview and capabilities

This pipeline template is implementing the [Git-based process and branching model for mainframe development](https://ibm.github.io/z-devops-acceleration-program/docs/git-branching-model-for-mainframe-dev) within an Azure DevOps context.

It leverages the [Common Backend scripts](../Common-Backend-Scripts/) to implement the Setup, Build, Packaging and Deployment stages. 

The pipeline implements the following stages

* `Setup` stage to [clone](../Common-Backend-Scripts/README.md#41---gitclonesh) the Git repository to a workspace directory on z/OS Unix System Services. 
* `Build` stage 
  * to invoke the zAppBuild [build](../Common-Backend-Scripts/README.md#42---dbbbuildsh) framework,
  * to [prepare](../Common-Backend-Scripts/README.md#49---preparelogssh) the log files and publish them to the Azure build result.
  * in case of a release pipeline, to create the release candidate tag.
* `Packaging` stage
  * to create a new [UCD component](../Common-Backend-Scripts/README.md#45---ucdpackagingsh) version (commented out)
  * to create a package (TAR file) based on the [PackageBuildOutputs script](../Common-Backend-Scripts/README.md#44---packagebuildoutputssh)
  * to load the package file to the Azure Artifacts
* `Deployment` stage to the development test environment
  * to run the Wazi Deploy [generate command](../Common-Backend-Scripts/README.md#47---wazideploy-generatesh)
  * to deploy the package with the Wazi Deploy [deploy command](../Common-Backend-Scripts/README.md#48---wazideploy-deploysh) (Python-based)
  * to run the Wazi Deploy [evidence command](../Common-Backend-Scripts/README.md#49---wazideploy-evidencesh) to generate deployment report and updating the evidence.
  * to [prepare](../Common-Backend-Scripts/README.md#49---preparelogssh) the deployment log files and publish them to the Azure build result.
* `Deployment` to controlled test environments via the [release pipeline](https://ibm.github.io/z-devops-acceleration-program/docs/branching-model-supporting-pipeline#the-release-pipeline-with-build-packaging-and-deploy-stages) that includes:
  * to create a git tag to flag the release candidate. 
  * to retrieve the package from the Azure Artifacts binary repository.
  * to deploy the package with the Wazi Deploy [deploy command](../Common-Backend-Scripts/README.md#48---wazideploy-deploysh) (Python-based)
  * to run the Wazi Deploy [evidence command](../Common-Backend-Scripts/README.md#49---wazideploy-evidencesh) to generate deployment report and updating the evidence.
  * to [prepare](../Common-Backend-Scripts/README.md#49---preparelogssh) the deployment log files and publish them to the Azure build result.
  * to create a git tag of the commit that was deployed to the production environment.
* `Cleanup` stage: 
  * to [delete the build workspace](../Common-Backend-Scripts/README.md#411---deleteworkspacesh) on z/OS Unix System Services.

Depending on your selected deployment technology, review the definitions and (de-)/activate the appropriate steps.

The pipeline uses the Azure concepts `Stage`, `Jobs` and `Tasks`, as well as [Azure DevOps templates](#supplied-azure-pipeline-templates).

## Prerequisites

To leverages this template, access to an Azure DevOps environment is required, and an Azure DevOps Pipeline agent must be configured to connect to your mainframe environment. Please review the setup instructions of this [techdoc](https://www.ibm.com/support/pages/node/6422813).

The template leverages the [SSH Task](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/tasks/reference/ssh-v0?view=azure-pipelines) to invoke the [Common Backend scripts](../Common-Backend-Scripts/) via the configured SSH endpoint. Alternatively, the template can be modified to use the [CmdLine task](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/tasks/reference/cmd-line-v2?view=azure-pipelines) to leverage an alternative communication technology such as Zowe CLI.

The Common Backend Scripts need to be configured for the selected deployment technologies to operate correctly.

To tag important commits in the history of the application's Git repository, the Azure CLI is used and must be available on the Azure runner. Please follow the [documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli) to install the Azure CLI on all the agents within the agent pool that the pipelines will use.

## Installation and setup of template

**Note: Please work with your ADO pipeline specialist to review the below section.**

The `azure-pipeline.yaml` can be dropped into the root folder of your Azure Git repository and will automatically provide pipelines for the specified triggers. Please review the definitions thoroughly with your Azure administrator. 

Following requirements need to be met:
* An [Azure Agent](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/agents/agents?view=azure-devops) is installed and can connect to the z/OS system where builds are occurring.
* An [Azure SSH Service Connection](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/library/service-endpoints?view=azure-devops&tabs=yaml#ssh-service-connection) is set up to connect to the z/OS system with SSH. This service connection is used by the Azure SSH-based tasks in the pipeline.
* The private SSH key of the TSO technical user to login to z/OS Unix System Services from scripts is installed as a Secure file. See [Install private SSH key](#install-private-ssh-key)

### Required pipeline variables

Variable | Description
--- | ---
  agentPool                            | Agent pool name for Azure Agents to connect to MVS
  zosSSHConnection                     | zOS - The name of the Azure SSH connection name for connecting to z/OS Unix System Services of the LPAR where the build actions will be performed.
  zosSSHKnownHost                      | The known host entry for secure shell connections. [See Notes](#obtaining-the-known-host-entry-for-secure-shell-connections).
  zosSSHPrivateKeySecureFile           |Â Reference to uploaded Private SSH Key in ADO Pipeline/Libary/SecureFile that is installed for sftp processes. [See Notes](#upload-private-ssh-key-as-secure-file)
  pipelineWorkspace                    | Root directory on z/OS Unix System services to perform builds. E.g. `/u/ado/workspace`
  zosHostname                          | zOS - Host name (or Host IP address) for SFTP connection
  zosSFTPUser                          | zOS - Host user for SFTP connection
  azureArtifactFeedID                  | Feed ID of the Azure artifact for publishing the package (when publishing to Azure DevOps Artifacts)
  azureArtifactVersionOption           | Azure artifact version option (when publishing to Azure DevOps Artifacts)

### Supplied Azure pipeline templates 

The directory [templates](templates/) contains additional [Azure pipeline templates](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/process/templates?view=azure-devops&pivots=templates-includes#parameters-to-select-a-template-at-runtime) that implement actions used in the main pipeline template. This approach helps to keep central control over the tagging and release deployment process. Please review the templates with your Azure administrator and adjust the reference within the [azure-pipelines.yml](azure-pipelines.yml#L32) file.

The tagging process implemented in the template leverages the [AZ REST command of the Azure DevOps CLI](templates/tagging/createReleaseCandidate.yml#L33) to connect with the existing permissions of the pipeline build user to the Azure repository to create the release candidate and the final release tag. Azure DevOps CLI needs to be available on the installed Azure agents.  

### Azure environments

This template uses [Azure deployment jobs](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/process/deployment-jobs?view=azure-devops) to trigger the deployment on the mainframe and document the deployment of packages to the defined [environments in Azure](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/process/environments?view=azure-devops). Please create the environments in advance, also consider configuring approvals and checks for environments as gates.

The template allows the development team to add additional environments where they would like to deploy the package to. Please see the [deployment section of the pipeline configuration](azure-pipelines.yml#L187).

### Installing the private SSH key

To execute actions on the z/OS system, the default communication channel is established via the SSH Service Connection that is provided by Azure.
To download files from the build workspace on z/OS Unix System Services, the pipeline uses a `CmdLine` task and leverage a script to pull the log files from the mainframe to the Azure agent. The used SSH communication from a `CmdLine` task does not use the Azure Service Connection. To make the agent installation independent of any configurations outside of Azure, a private SSH key is installed as part of the pipeline to connect to the z/OS system through a `CmdLine` task. 

The configuration requires 
1) the `zosSSHKnownHost` pipeline variable, and
2) uploading a Secure File `ssh_key_ado` that is referenced in the pipeline definition. 

#### Obtaining the known host entry for secure shell connections

For any actions over secure shell, that are executed outside of the Azure SSH Task, the pipeline is installing the private SSH key of the z/OS user and the entry for the `known_hosts` file.

**Obtaining the known host entry**

Open a terminal and issue `ssh-keyscan eoleb7.dat.ibm.com` - with using the z/OS hostname as argument.

 ```
    ssh-keyscan eoleb7.dat.ibm.com          
    # eoleb7.dat.ibm.com:22 SSH-2.0-OpenSSH_7.6
    eoleb7.dat.ibm.com ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAABIwAAAIEAwzoxzESrEqeWmAZNIa6NWJXh6l+BgX8JlZ3er1tMUAxKBEQ7aBKbCb+64P1m0TbpWhVMEYZBmHhpvAn6N86/4YLWCn8sJmshC9u7bag3dcSorIDO+/el2ochP+Ub4cD/V3DvOxVBsjK+a2nPBDZDbDjI5jdjEDfTC/uXRdQA3Qs=
    # eoleb7.dat.ibm.com:22 SSH-2.0-OpenSSH_7.6
    # eoleb7.dat.ibm.com:22 SSH-2.0-OpenSSH_7.6
```

Select the uncommented line as the value for the `zosSSHKnownHost` key of the pipeline variable.

#### Upload private SSH key as Secure File

To upload the private key as a Secure File: 

* obtain the private SSH key from the location where you generated it. For instance, use `scp` to download the private key to your workstation. 
* upload the private SSH key as a Secure File and set the appropriate permissions that the pipeline can use it. For more information, please checkout the [ADO documentation on Secure Files](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/library/secure-files?view=azure-devops). 

## Pipeline usage

The pipeline implements the common build, package and deploy steps to process various configurations according to the defined conventions.
It is a single Azure pipeline definition supporting various workflows. The [azure-pipelines.yml](azure-pipelines.yml) supports: 

* automated [build pipelines for feature branches](https://ibm.github.io/z-devops-acceleration-program/docs/branching-model-supporting-pipeline#pipeline-build-of-feature-branches) with a clone and build stage, 
* the [basic pipeline](https://ibm.github.io/z-devops-acceleration-program/docs/branching-model-supporting-pipeline#the-basic-build-pipeline-for-main-epic-and-release-branches) when changes are merged into the branch `main` and
* a [release pipeline](https://ibm.github.io/z-devops-acceleration-program/docs/branching-model-supporting-pipeline#the-release-pipeline-with-build-packaging-and-deploy-stages) to build and package the release candidate, installation to predefined environments including the production environment.

Please check the pipeline definition to understand the various triggers for which this pipeline is executed and also the conditions when stages, jobs or steps are executed. 

Please make yourself familiar with the [Git branching for mainframe development](https://ibm.github.io/z-devops-acceleration-program/docs/git-branching-model-for-mainframe-dev/#characteristics-of-mainline-based-development-with-feature-branches) documentation. 

### Pipeline parameters 

In a default setup, the pipeline is triggered for each new commit.

It allows overriding the below parameters when manually requesting the pipeline.
This is especially useful when the application team want to create a release candidate package for higher test environments and production. 

Parameter | Description
--- | ---
pipelineType     | Pipeline type - either build, release or preview. (Default: build)
releaseType      |Â Release type - major, minor, patch as input to compute the release version and to set the release candidate and release git tags. (Default: patch)
verbose          | boolean flag to control logging of build framework. (Default: false) 

### Feature Branch pipeline

The pipeline for feature branches executes the following steps:

* Clone
* Build
* Package & publish package
* Cleanup

### Basic build pipeline for Integration branches

The basic build pipeline for integration branches contains the following stages:
* Clone
* Build 
* Package & publish package
* Deployment to the integration test environment
* Cleanup

Overview of the pipeline: 

![Basic pipeline for integration branches](images/ado_basicBuildPipeline.png)

### Release pipeline

When the development team agrees to build a release candidate, the release pipeline type is triggered manually.

It covers the followings steps:
* Clone
* Build, tagging of the release candidate
* Package & publish package
* Deployment to the controlled test environments
* Deployment to the production environment, including tagging the production release state
* Cleanup

The development team manually requests the pipeline and specifies the *pipeline type* `release` as a parameter. Along with the *release type*, the pipeline will tag a release candidate and also the final release that is deployed to production.
