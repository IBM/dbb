# Common Backend Scripts for Pipeline Implementations

## 1 - Overview

The Common Backend Scripts for Pipeline Implementations is a collection of scripts that deliver central "services" and a simplified interface for pipeline configurations that implement a Git/DBB-based pipeline for Mainframe applications.

Implementing a pipeline configuration, such as an Azure pipeline, a JenkinsFile, or the .gitlab-ci.yml file, requires accommodation of the selected development workflow with Git. To achieve consistency across various applications, rules must be implemented in pipeline code or configurations to address:
* naming conventions of build datasets,
* configuration parameters of the build framework,
* or naming conventions of the binary package



The community is providing a set of [pipeline tasks](../../Pipeline/) that implement the various stages of the pipeline orchestration. The tasks (generally implemented as groovy scripts) accept/require various parameters; some are related to the application, while others represent a technical configuration that is required for the script to operate.

The purpose of these common backend scripts is to reduce the necessary configuration and scripting within a concrete pipeline orchestration logic and let the application and pipeline teams focus on the application specific parameters.

Instead of mixing **orchestration of tasks** and **implementation of the pipeline rules** (such as computation of build HLQ, build type, etc) in the specific pipeline technology (e.g. a Jenkinsfile or a .gitlab-ci.yaml definition), the common backend scripts provide central services to the pipeline orchestrator, independently from the chosen orchestration technology.

By simplifying the invocation of the [pipeline tasks](../../Pipeline/), these scripts help the DevOps engineer to implement the pipeline configuration, especially for pipeline orchestrators that do not have a runner/agent available on z/OS UNIX System Services.

In addition, this repository contains a [test driver](test/) to outline how the scripts can be remotely invoked from non-z/OS systems. Additional templates for the various pipeline orchestrators (such as an azure-pipeline.yaml), is planned to be provided as well, to showcase how the Common Backend Scripts should be used.

This asset implements the rules and conventions of the Git-based workflow outlined in IBMs documentation `The Git-based workflow you need for Mainframe development` with a defined Git branching, build and packaging strategy.

## 2 - Set up

The provided scripts of this asset are implemented as bash scripts and need to be installed on UNIX System Services of the z/OS system that is used to execute the pipeline's tasks.

### 2.1 - Pre-requisites
The following are required to use these scripts:
* DBB v2.x toolkit is installed.
* zAppBuild is set up on Unix Systems Services.
* Git repository which follows the Git-based workflow outlined in IBM's documentation `The Git-based workflow for Mainframe development`.
* Build dependency information is available before performing the build run.


### 2.2 - Installation

* Copy/clone the Common Backend Scripts into z/OS UNIX System Services under a protected directory, e.g. `/usr/dbb/pipelineBackend`.
  * Update the permission of these scripts to allow for `read/execute` to only the users who will invoke the scripts. This is typically the technical user defined for the pipeline orchestrator. 

* The following environment variables need to be defined (for instance within the `.profile`) for the mainframe users who will execute the scripts on UNIX System Services:

  * `PIPELINE_SCRIPTS` - Environment variable to define the path to the Common Backend Scripts. 
  
     Add the directory path where you stored the scripts to the PATH of the pipeline user's profile, to make the scripts available to the consumers without referring to an absolute path within the pipeline configuration; most likely, this is the mainframe technical user used by the pipeline orchestrator. This avoids the need to set the working directory to the scripts when invoking them. In a non-interactive SSH setup, please make sure to initialize the environment variables for instance by executing the user's .profile, or by running a environment setup script.

  * (Optional) `PIPELINE_WORKSPACE` - Environment variable to configure the root workspace directory to run pipeline activities.

     Assumed to be a dedicated zFS filesystem that is in control of the pipeline user. Can be used in pipeline orchestration implementations to locate the path of logs or outputs. If not configured, the pipeline configuration needs to provide an absolute path to the working directory.

The below shows an extract of the pipeline user's `.profile` file:

  ```sh
  # extract of user's .profile to add the pipeline_config
  #
  # env variable to define the path to the backend scripts
  export PIPELINE_SCRIPTS=/var/dbb/common-wrapper-scripts
  export PATH=$PIPELINE_SCRIPTS:$PATH 

  # environment variable to define the pipeline root workspace directory
  export PIPELINE_WORKSPACE=/var/dbb/pipeline-workspace
  ```

### 2.3 - Script configuration

The scripts are designed to be configurable through the [pipelineBackend.config](pipelineBackend.config) file. This configuration file is located in the same directory as all the backend script files. 

Although each script is designed to work independently of the other scripts, they share common properties such as the root workspace directory for the pipeline scripts, and the directory for log files. These common properties are defined in the [pipelineBackend.config](pipelineBackend.config) file which are used across the backend scripts. 

The following are common properties in the [pipelineBackend.config](pipelineBackend.config) file. 

 
Central configuration | Description
---------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
buildRootDir | Absolute path to define the root workspace directory for pipeline executions, e.q. `/usr/pipeline/workspace`. Pipeline configurations can only pass a unique relative workspace.
logsDir | A relative directory name for logs and temporary outputs. Default: logs
zAppBuild settings | Multiple settings for zAppBuild, like path and credentials
UCD settings | Multiple settings for UCD server, like URL and credentials
Wazi Deploy settings | Multiple settings for Wazi Deploy Generation, Deployment and Evidence Requests commands

Central function | Description
---------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
getWorkDirectory() | Central function to calculate the absolute path of the working directory
getLogDir() | Central function to calculate the absolute path of the log directory
getApplicationDir() | Central function to calculate the absolute path of the application directory (where the application is stored)

The details of the configuration settings are provided in the comments of the configuration file.


### 2.4 - Required workspace directory

All the scripts are designed to have a unique working directory or workspace. The workspace is for managing the clone of the Git repository, and the log and output directories to avoid any conflicts and collisions. When invoking any of the scripts, the workspace is a required parameter which can either be an absolute path or a relative path. 

If a relative path is provided, the value of the workspace parameter is combined with the `buildRootDir` setting that is defined in the [pipelineBackend.config](pipelineBackend.config) as `<buildRootDir>/<workspace>`.

In the sample below, we use a workspace path consisting of 3 segments which are the **application name**, the **branch name** and the **pipeline build id**. This is the recommended approach, to ensure a unique workspace directory on z/OS UNIX System Services:

```
<Application>/<branch>/<pipeline-id>
```
The branch and pipelineID segments are resolved from the pipeline orchestrator via its built-in variables to:
```
MortApp/main/build-1
```

## 3 - Invocation of scripts

Scripts can be invoked from a non-z/OS pipeline runner/agent via 
* SSH connection
* ZOWE CLI
* or natively, to include steps (such as build and packaging phase) in a pipeline configuration that is executed under z/OS UNIX System Services. 

### 3.1 - Invocation samples: non-interactive SSH session

A non-interactive SSH session comes with a lightweight setup and is not fully initialized, like an interactive session can be by automatically loading the user's profile. The environment should be setup through the user's profile. The following snippet requires `bash` to be part of the PATH environment variable:
```
ssh pipelineuser@lpar ". /u/pipelineuser/.profile && dbbBuild.sh -w MortApp/main/build-1 -a MortgageApplication -b main"
```

An alternate configuration is to have `bash` defined as the default program in the OMVS segment of the user.

### 3.2 - Invocation samples: ZOWE CLI

Zowe CLI by default initializes the environment with the user's profile:
```
zowe zos-uss issue ssh "dbbBuild.sh -w MortApp/main/build-1 -a MortgageApplication -b main
```

### 4.1 - gitClone.sh

Script to clone a repository to z/OS UNIX System Services. Please note that it is not pulling for updates. 

#### Invocation

The `gitClone.sh` script can be invoked as below:

```
gitClone.sh -w MortApp/main/build-1 -r git@github.com:Organization/MortgageApplication.git -b main
```

CLI parameter | Description
---------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-w `<workspace>` | **Workspace directory**, an absolute or relative path that represents unique directory for this pipeline definition, that needs to be consistent through multiple steps. 
-r `<repoURL>` | **Git repository URL**, can either be SSH or HTTPS-based. Example: `-r git@github.com:Organization/MortgageApplication.git`
-b `<branch>` | **Git branch** that should be checked out. Example: `-b main`
-a `<application>` | (Optional) **Application name** to specify the directory into which git will clone. This is required for instance in the scenario if the repository name differs from the application name that is used in the build phase. Example: `-a CBSA`.

**Dealing with private repositories**

Although credentials should be managed in the secret vault of your pipeline orchestrator, you can pass credentials via the Git Repository URL, as follows:
```
gitClone.sh -w MortApp/main/build-1 -r https://<personal-access-token>@github.com/user/dbb-zappbuild-private.git -b main 
```

### 4.2 - dbbBuild.sh

This script implements the invocation of the [zAppBuild](https://github.com/IBM/dbb-zappbuild) framework. As designed, it makes use of the [baselineRef sub-option](https://github.com/IBM/dbb-zappbuild/blob/documentation-review/docs/BUILD.md#perform-impact-build-by-providing-baseline-reference-for-the-analysis-of-changed-files) provided by zAppBuild. The [dbbBuildUtils.sh](utilities/dbbBuildUtils.sh) script is used to compute the build configuration depending on the workflow to define zAppBuild CLI parameters. It leverages the [application baseline configuration](samples/baselineReference.config) file which is expected to be present in the `application-conf`` directory in order to compute the baseline reference and its changes.

#### Git branches naming convention requirements

The build script follows the naming conventions for branches that are outlined in the document in the [solution guide](https://ibm.github.io/z-devops-acceleration-program/docs/git-branching-model-for-mainframe-dev#naming-conventions):

```properties
## integration branches
#
# main Build branch
main
# release maintenance branches to fix a release that is been put to production
release/rel-1.0.0
# project/initiative/epic branches
epic/epic1234
project/project1

## feature branches
#
# feature branches for contributing to the next planned release via main
feature/setmainbuildbranch
feature/43-set-main-build-branch
# release maintenance feature branches
#  second segment is indicating the release
hotfix/rel-1.0.0/fixMortgageApplication
# feature branches for epics / larger development initiatives
#  second segment is referencing the epic context
feature/epic1234/54-my-first-cool-new-feature
```

Details are documented in [dbbBuildUtils.sh](README.md#script-capabilities--dbbbuildutilssh).

#### Invocation

The `dbbBuild.sh` script can be invoked as follows:

```
dbbBuild.sh -w MortApp/main/build-1 -a MortgageApplication -b main -p build
```

CLI parameter | Description
---------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-w `<workspace>` | **Workspace directory**, an absolute or relative path that represents unique directory for this pipeline definition, that needs to be consistent through multiple steps.
-a `<application>` | **Application name** to be built, which is passed to zAppBuild as the `--application` parameter.
-b `<branch>` | **Git branch** that is built. Used to compute various build properties such as the `--hlq` and build type.
-p `<build/release/preview>` | (Optional) **Pipeline Type** to indicate a `build` pipeline (build only with test/debug options) or a `release` pipeline (build for optimized load modules), or if it runs in `preview` mode.
-v | (Optional) zAppBuild verbose tracing flag.
-t `<buildTypeArgument>` | (Optional) **zAppBuild Build Type** to specify the build type, such as `--fullBuild`, or `--impactBuild`. Arguments must be provided between quotes - e.g.: `-t '--fullBuild'`. Providing this parameter overrides the computation of the build type in the backend scripts. For instance can be used to initialize the DBB Metadatastore. 
-q `<hlqPrefix>` |(Optional) **HLQ prefix**. Default is retrieved from the [pipelineBackend.config](pipelineBackend.config) file, if the configuration file is not modified - the default value is set to the user executing the script.

**Pipeline type**

The type of pipeline (`-p` option), is used to modify the operational behavior of the build framework on producing executables:
* `build` configures the build options for test/debug options. This is the **default**.
* `release` used to indicate to produce executables with the flag for performance-optimized runtime modules. This is required for the release pipelines which include release candidate packages.
* `preview` configures the build process to execute without producing any outputs. It is used to preview what the build will do. The pipeline should not have any subsequent actions.

### 4.3 - Script utility - dbbBuildUtils.sh

The [dbbBuildUtils](utilities/dbbBuildUtils.sh) script is a utility script providing the `computeBuildConfiguration()` method to compute the zAppBuild's options and parameters:

* `build type`, such as `--impactBuild`
* the baseline reference, `--baselineRef xxx`, where *xxx* is retrieved from the baselineReference.config file.
* flag to produce test modules (`--debug` in zAppBuild) or modules improved for performance (production runtime modules).
* the `mainBuildBranch` to configure feature branches to clone the correct dependency metadata collections and to identify the correct offset of changes.

#### Baseline references requirements

The IBM recommended workflow approach leverages Git tags to identify the offset for calculating the changed files for a given deliverable. In this version, this utility script is retrieving the information from the [baselineReference.config](samples/baselineReference.config) file, that has to be maintained by the application team within the `application-conf` directory. It is the application teams' responsibility to maintain these references. 

Note that the location of the baselineReferences.config file can be customized in the [pipelineBackend.config](pipelineBackend.config) file.

[MortgageApplication-baselineReference.config](MortgageApplication-baselineReference.config) is a sample, that indicates the baseline for the `main` and `release maintenance` branch.

### 4.4 - packageBuildOutputs.sh

This script is to execute the `PackageBuildOutputs.groovy` that packages up the build outputs and optionally uploads it to an artifact repository to publish the artifacts created by a DBB build in the pipeline.

#### Invocation

The `packageBuildOutputs.sh` script can be invoked as follows:

- Package only

```
packageBuildOutputs.sh -w MortApp/main/build-1 -t rel-1.0.0.tar
```
- Package and Upload
```
packageBuildOutputs.sh -w MortApp/main/build-1 -t rel-1.0.0.tar -a MortgageApplication -b main -u -p release -v rel-1.0.0.2023-09-22-08.55.20
```

CLI parameter | Description
---------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Packaging options**
-w `<workspace>` | **Workspace directory**, an absolute or relative path that represents unique directory for this pipeline definition, that needs to be consistent through multiple steps. The `packageBuildOutputs.sh` script is evaluating the logs directory.
-t `<tarFileName>` | (Optional) Name of the **tar file** to create.
**Artifact Upload options**
-u | Flag to enable upload of outputs to the configured artifact repository.
-a `<application>` | **Application name** leveraged to define the artifact repository name. See function `computeArtifactRepositoryName()` in the pipelineBackend.config file. Ex.: `MortgageApplication-repo-local`. 
-b `<branch>`| Name of the **git branch** turning into a segment of the directory path in the artifact repository. See function `computeArtifactRepositoryDirectory()` in the pipelineBackend.config file.
-p `<build/release>` | **Pipeline type** to indicate a `build` pipeline (build only with test/debug options) or a `release` pipeline (build for  optimized load modules) to determine the directory in the artifact repository for development and pipeline builds.
-v `<artifactVersion>` | Label of the **version** in the artifact repository turning into a segment of the directory path in the artifact repo.

#### Script conventions

**Directory Path within the artifact repo**

For uploading, the backend script computes the directory path within the artifact repository :
* **Branch**/**artifactVersion**

If it is the `main` branch, the pipeline type (-p) is evaluated to 
* **Branch**/**pipelineType <build/release>**/**artifactVersion**
 
while **artifactVersion** is appended by the `PackageBuildOutputs.groovy` script.

### 4.9 - wazideploy-evidence.sh

This script invokes the Wazi Deploy Evidence command to generate a Deployment report from the Wazi Deploy Evidence YAML file created by the Wazi Deploy Deploy command.

#### Invocation

The `wazideploy-evidence.sh` script can be invoked as follows:

Only mandatory parameters, and using relative paths:
```
wazideploy-evidence.sh -w MortgageApplication/main/build-20231101.15
```
or qualified paths with optional parameters:
```
wazideploy-evidence.sh -w /u/ado/workspace/MortgageApplication/main/build-20231101.15 -l /u/ado/workspace/MortgageApplication/main/build-20231101.15/deploy/evidences/evidence.yaml -o /u/ado/workspace/MortgageApplication/main/build-20231101.15/deploy/deployment-report.html
```

CLI parameter | Description
---------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-w `<workspace>` | **Workspace directory**, an absolute or relative path that represents unique directory for this pipeline definition, that needs to be consistent through multiple steps. Optional, if `deploymentPlan`, `environmentFile`, `packageInputFile` and `evidenceFile` are fully referenced. 
-l `<evidenceFile>` | (Optional) Absolute or relative path to the **Evidence File** that contains the logs of all Wazi Deploy tasks. If not specified, evidence file location will be obtained from the `pipelineBackend.config`.
-o `<outputFile>` | (Optional) Absolute or relative path to the **Output File** that will contain the Deployment Report. If not specified, evidence file location will be obtained from the `pipelineBackend.config`.

### 4.10 - prepareLogs.sh

Script to obtain the logs that were produced as part of the pipeline steps in the *logs* directory. 

#### Invocation

The `prepareLogs.sh` script can be invoked as follows:

```
prepareLogs.sh -w MortApp/main/build-1
```

CLI parameter | Description
---------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-w `<workspace>` | **Workspace directory**, an absolute or relative path that represents unique directory for this pipeline definition, that needs to be consistent through multiple steps. 

On successful completion, the script writes a message to indicate the output directory with the log file name:
```
Logs successfully stored at /var/dbb/pipelineBackend/workspace/MortApp/feature/setmainbuildbranch/build-1/logs.tar
```

 #### Script output

#### Download logs to non-z/OS runner/agent environment

While the script `prepareLogs.sh` only creates the TAR file on the workspace directory, the next step is to download the TAR file to the non-z/OS runner/agent environment, in order to attach it to the pipeline results.

The following sample illustrates the invocation of the `prepareLogs.sh` script and inspects the console output for the message `Logs successfully stored at ` indicating that a TAR file was successfully created. 
It _greps_ the information and invokes a download action.

```shell
    cmdStr="prepareLogs.sh -w MortApp/main/build-1"
    echo "$cmdStr"
    zowe zos-uss issue ssh "${cmdStr}" | tee prepareLogsOutput.txt

    # read logs 
    logsTar=$(cat prepareLogsOutput.txt | grep "Logs successfully stored at " | awk -F "stored at " ' { print $2 }')
    
    if [ ! -z "${logsTar}" ]; then
        # use zowe cli to download file to local environment
        # sftp / scp can be alternative download options.
        zowe zos-files download uss-file "$logsTar" -f ./logs/MortApp/main/build-1/logs.tar -b
    else 
        rc=4
        echo "[WARNING] Tar file containing the logs was not found. rc="$rc
    fi
```
