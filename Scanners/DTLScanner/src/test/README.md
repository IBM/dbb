# Test the DTL Scanner

## Pre-requisites 

You need to build the scanner and upload them to z/OS Unix System services

## Run test

* Upload the supplied sample dtl source [FLMB#P.dtlenu](dtl/FLMB#P.dtlenu) to a location in USS.
* Upload the supplied sample groovy script to USS
* Customize paths in [dependencyScanner.groovy](groovy/dependencyScanner.groovy) to the locations where you uploaded the sample source codes.
* Execute the test script like `groovyz -cp /var/dbb/dbb-extensions/dtlScanner_0.1.0.jar dependencyScanner.groovy`

## Expected console log

The test script is instantiating the DTLDependencyScanner, scans the file and prints the logical file.
